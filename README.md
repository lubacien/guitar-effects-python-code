guitar effects python code:

The following files are effect tests using the STM32 microcontroller architecture, using guitar32000.wav as initial sound and adding effects to it:

allpassdelay.py
allpassdelaynetwork.py
chorus.py
chorus-extravoice.py (implements the chorus effect with 3 voices, whereas chorus is only 1)
delaydecimator.py
delayFIR.py
delayIIR.py
overdrive.py
SchroederReverberator.py

The file makecostable.py creates a cosine table used for a low frequency oscillatos in the chorus effect
